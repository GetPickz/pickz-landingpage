          <h2>1. Our Privacy Philosophy</h2>
          <p>Pickz was built to replace anonymous reviews with trusted advice. Unlike traditional social media, we believe your recommendations should only be seen by the people you actually know—and the people <i>they</i> know. We don’t sell your trust to advertisers.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="policy-section">
          <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> Your name and phone number used to verify your identity.</li>
            <li><strong>Contacts:</strong> With your permission, we sync your contacts to identify your "Level 1" friends. We do not store these numbers for marketing purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Your Pickz:</strong> The recommendations you save, which are shared within your trusted network.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="policy-section">
          <h2>3. The "Hidden by Design" Rule</h2>
          <p>Your data visibility is strictly limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> Your direct friends.</li>
            <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> Friends of your friends.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Strangers and anonymous users can never see your profile or your recommendations. This is our core privacy promise.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="policy-section">
          <h2>4. Data Deletion</h2>
          <p>You own your data. You can delete your account and all associated "Pickz" at any time directly through the app settings.</p>
